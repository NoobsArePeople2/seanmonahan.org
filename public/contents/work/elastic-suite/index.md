### Elastic Suite

#### *Elastic is a suite of custom-branded business-to-business tools that run where they are needed &mdash; on desktops, tablets and web browsers.*

<br/>
Elastic is designed from the ground up to put products and brands at the forefront with custom skins and high-resolution images for all products. Not just a pretty face Elastic has features like product filtering, offline mode, rapid order entry, order history, cloud save and more that enable users to work quickly and effectively. Backed by the Elastic Server all Elastic Apps can share files. Start an order on the computer at the office? No worries, just use the cloud features of Elastic and open in a web browser at home.

Elastic is the result of working closely with clients, understanding their needs and workflows, and building a system that integrates smoothly into their systems. Check out these videos showing off some of Elastic's most loved features.

#### Keyword Filter

Have several hundred products to sift through? Use the keyword filter to rapidly trim down results.

#### Color Filter

Maybe you need to match some colors? There’s a filter for that.

#### Filter Stacking

Of course, sometimes a more specific search is necessary. Fortunately filters are stackable.

#### Quick Add

Drag and drop is great for casually exploring a catalog but it's not the fastest way to do things. Use Quick Add to rapidly search for and add products all via hotkeys.

#### Whiteboarding and PDF Output

Once you have everything for you order it’s nice to review and see if everything fits together nicely. Enter whiteboarding: drag, drop and arrange all the items in your cart to make sure you’ve got everything you need. You can even export to PDF for future reference.
