# About Sean

I'm a software developer focused on creating great experiences on the web and mobile. My work includes ticket sales sites, desktop B2B sales and merchandising tools, ePub readers and mobile apps.

My preferred tools of the trade are currently Javascript, Angular, jQuery, SASS/Compass, HTML5 and Unity. On the server-side of things I use PHP and Node.js but have been known to write some Ruby.

I'm also comfortable with Cordova, Wordpress, Flex, Actionscript 3, Cocos2D, Moai, and Lua.

Presently I work in downtown Seattle as the Development Director at Tag Creative Studio. I lead a small team of developers and work with our design team to craft products for clients in ecommerce, education and virtual reality.

Outside of software I enjoy both mountain and road biking, books, video games and beer (making and drinking it). You can find me on these sites:
