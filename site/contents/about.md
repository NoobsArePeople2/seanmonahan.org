# About Sean

I'm a software developer living and working in Seattle, WA. I make games, apps and websites for desktop and mobile. My work includes online ticket sales sites, desktop B2B sales and merchandising tools, mobile apps, games, Wordpress sites and a handful of tools to support these endeavors.

I currently work at [Typeoneerror](http://typeoneerror.com).

Outside of software I enjoy both mountain and road biking, books, videogames and beer (making and drinking it). You can find me on these sites:
