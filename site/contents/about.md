# About Sean

I'm a software developer living and working in Seattle, WA. I make websites, apps and games for desktop and mobile. My work includes ticket sales sites, desktop B2B sales and merchandising tools, mobile apps, games, Wordpress sites and a handful of tools to support these endeavors.

My preferred tools of the trade are currently Javascript (and sometimes Coffeescript), Angular, jQuery, SASS/Compass and, naturally, HTML5. On the server-side of things I use PHP but have been known to write some Ruby.

I'm also comfortable using Wordpress, Flex, Actionscript 3, Cocos2D, Moai, and Lua.

Presently I work at Tag Creative Studio in downtown Seattle. I also work on small freelance projects on the side so [let's chat](/contact) if you think we could work together on something.

Outside of software I enjoy both mountain and road biking, books, video games and beer (making and drinking it). You can find me on these sites:
