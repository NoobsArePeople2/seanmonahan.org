## Starting Splat

The <a href="http://www.seattlegam.es/" target="_blank">Seattle Games Co-op</a> is a wonderful group of game makers in the Seattle area that have lots of "meet up" events. One of these is a monthly game design workshop where a bunch of us get together on a Sunday afternoon, split up into a groups, cook up some games and then show them off to each other.

This past Sunday my group made a game we dubbed "Splat". Splat is a game about skydiving...with only one parachute between two to four players (three seems to be optimal). The goal of the game is the grab the parachute and land safely while leaving the other players to splat into the ground.

Splat is the second game I've made at the game design workshop and, like the previous time, I've found myself thinking about how I'd build the game out as a video game. This is more of an exercise in thinking about how I'd make a game on a technical level rathar than some grand plan to actually build the thing. Another task I've given myself is to learn <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and my next step with that is to find some project I can build out without _too_ much work to kick the tires.

So I'm building Splat in HTML, Javascript and Angular because, why not? A game like Splat is perfectly doable in plain old HTML/JS and using Angular gives me a neat first project there. Since Splat is a board game without any real-time interactive components a bunch of DOM elements should work fine. I guess we'll see how it goes as another part of this is to write more so I'll be writing here regularly (aiming for everyday that I actually work on the project) which means you can follow along!
