## Splat, Day One

A more accurate description would be "evening one" but that doesn't have quite the right sound to it. Anyway, my first day on Splat was spent researching what I need to set up a dev environment for Angular. As it turns out there are quite a few options but I settled on the <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a> and it's Angular generator project.

I went with Yeoman because it looked like the most "just press button for awesome Angular setup" thing I was going to find. Getting my project set up was:

    $ yo angular

some waiting while the zillions of dependencies were downloaded and installed and bam! a working Angular app! And not just a working Angular app but a fully functioning Grunt configuration with a nice server, helpful tools like JSHint and livereload, and all sorts of goodness. My focus with this project is actually building an app and not getting bogged down in initial project setup is a very nice feature. With the project set up I wire in a few views just to make sure things are working as expected and I'm off stubbing out some controllers and views. At this point I don't have much but tomorrow I'll be ready to get rolling.
