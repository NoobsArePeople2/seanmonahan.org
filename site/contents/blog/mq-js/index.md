## mq.js

Responsive sites are great for users. For developers they add another layer of complexity to building great sites. Sure, the extra work is worth it but keeping track of media queries for iPhones, Androids, all sorts and sizes of tablets, not to mention the vast array of laptops/desktops out there can be...well...tiring.

Fortunately websites are made with computers and computers are really great for automating away tiresome tasks. This is where [mq.js](https://github.com/NoobsArePeople2/mq.js) comes in. Mq.js is a Javascript utility that enables your site to tell you which media query is currently being applied to a page. It works on desktops, tablets, phones &mdash; really anything that supports CSS media queries. Oh, and it's plain ole Javascript so you don't need to use jQuery just to get some help.

Check out [this demo](/labs/mqjs/demo/) to see mq.js in action. I could repeat the setup instructions here but instead I'll point you to the <a href="https://github.com/NoobsArePeople2/mq.js" target="_blank">Github repo</a> which will show you how to get mq.js plugged into your site.
