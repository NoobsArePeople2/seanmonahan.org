## Splat's Rules

This is the first written draft of The Rules of Splat (well, technically it's the _second_ written draft as I did write them down in my notebook first). I think the rules need some tweaking in both the description and mechanics of them. Some of the instructions are wordy, others are a bit wonky (the game was made in less than two hours) still they serve as a good starting point. We begin with a short story:

You're up in the air for some skydiving when your feel a jolt and your plane lurches in a direction it shouldn't! You meet the other skydivers at the exit but now you've got another problem &mdash; there are three<sup>1</sup> of you and only one parachute. Another lurch and it plummets out the exit. Your best chance is to follow it out of the plane...

The board in Splat is a grid that is 5 cells wide by 10 cells high. Players start in the plane at the top of the board and travel the height of the board (i.e., 10 cells) to the bottom. Any player that hits the bottom without the parachute loses. A player wins by gaining possession of the parachute then either safely landing on the ground or surviving while all the other players smash into the ground. The sides of the board "wrap" so sides of the board can be thought of as being connected.

The board has between two and four players and a single parachute. Each turn begins with the parachute's turn. On the parachute's turn a die is rolled for a value between one and three. This value is how many cells the parachute will move straight down this turn. If the parachute is possessed by a player, prior to moving down the player can select to move the chute left or right one cell.

Players then take turns in order starting with the player chosen to go first. Turns proceed to the player to the left of the current player. On each turn the player rolls a die for a value between one and six. This is the number of cells the player can move through this round. The first step of the move _must_ be straight down. Subsequent steps can be left, right or down, but not up. During a move if the player lands on the parachute the player gains possession of the parachute and the turn ends.

If, during a move, the player collides with another player the mover displaces the victim and the turn ends. If the move is left or right the victim is displaced to the left or right respectively (this may result in subsequent displacements). If the mover collides with the victim from above the mover is pushed back up one cell while the victim is pushed down one cell. This is the only way to move back up the board.

When a player has the parachute that turn is skipped. Instead the player will play the parachute's turn.

The game continues until one player wins or the all lose.

Like I said at the top, these rules will probably see some changes but they're good enough to let me start the game.

<sup>1</sup> I say "three" because this felt like the best number in playtesting but two to four players are allowed.
