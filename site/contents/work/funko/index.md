## *Marvel Collector Corps is a subscription-based storefront for Funko collectibles.*

<br/>
I worked on a small team doing the initial setup and development for the Collector Corps subscription service. Collector Corps is a subscription service that ships a box containing a Funko figurine and other collectibles like t-shirts and pins every other month. Customers can elect for two different subscriptions &mdash; one continues for an entire year and another that can be canceled at anytime.

We worked with our hosting partner to create a hosting configuration that could handle the expected load of the site and verified this with load testing. I wrote custom rules for handling subscriptions to client specifications and implemented systems to integrate with the client's CRM system.
